			<h1>about ex animus</h1>
			<p>
				Every one of us goes through challenges and have to endure demanding situations throughout life. Often, through simply being open, attentive and reflective, I've found that there is usually something to be gained and understood from that which we experience: snippets of wisdom that may sum up the ordeal and or provide guidance for when similar things appear once again.
				<br><br>
				This project features proverbs and words of inspiration/wisdom that I've come up with: stemming from ordeals I've personally gone through and observed in life, having been formed based on my own personal evaluations and understanding of what they could possibly teach me.
				<br><br>
				Having accumulated so many over a period of time, I decided to share them here as the focal point of this project. I felt that I could do something creative and productive with all of them and that someone may vibe closely with an entry, or perhaps gain some inspiration/wisdom from another.
